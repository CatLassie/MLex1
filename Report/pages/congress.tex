\section{Experiments on Congress}
No difference between gini and Information gain for Decision Tree when using all features

physician-fee-freeze seems to be important as removing it from the features decreased metrics quite drastically

Surprisingly, adding or removing education-spending from the features did not make a significant difference.

Removing feature 'superfund-right-to-sue' slightly improved results for DT but no impact for NB.
