\subsection{Preprocessing}
Two imputation strategies: imputing value as col-mean and imputing it as mean of the class. Yielded no significant difference for KNN.
However, this might be due to the small size of the dataset. 
Additionally, when removing the five samples with missing values the performance of the algorithms increased.
