\section{Conclusion}
In our experiments we found that Gini Impurity works best for most decision tree problems.

Furthermore, we realised that data preprocessing is more difficult than expected and much more important then anticipated beforehand. 
This finding, however, is in-line with the 'garbage in - garbage out' theorem from the lecture. 
Unfortunately, wisdom usually hits when it is too late. Consequently, running a simple correlation analysis using pandas \verb|cor| function was not used in order to obtain better results. 
However, this poses as a major take away to us.
