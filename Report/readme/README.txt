    HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
   Here's an overview of the provided files and their use:
   
   config.tex : All the settings (what's the title, if the table of content is
                shown, etc.) can be found and edited here. This file should be 
                changed every time you create a new paper.
                
   content.tex: The content is supposed to come here. The advantage is you don't
                have to write in the messy template could - you can concentrate 
                soley on the content
   
   titlepage.tex: Here you will find the code of the titlepage. In usual cases
                (that means using it for a TU paper for the university) you
                won't have to change this. All the info (title,author,etc.)
                can be set in the config. If you don't like it - change it here.
                  
   additionalPreamble.tex: If you need definition before the document environment
                 or more packages you can put it here to keep the template clean.
   
   snippets: some collected examples and snippets ready to use
